# AMPLIFIER-SUGGESTION-MODEL-USING-ML
Traditional amplifier design relies on trial-and-error and manual tuning, which slows development as circuit complexity grows. This project uses Machine Learning with simulation tools to automate amplifier selection and optimization, enabling faster, smarter, and more reliable design.
